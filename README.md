### Introduction
This is a game developed using Scala with the help of the ScalaFX library. It consists of five stages in total, four stages are the main stages, and the other one stage is a mini-game that can be accessed on the main screen.

## Collision/Gravity Calculation
In order for me to mimic Gravity i had to calculate how fast the frame is being refreshed.
